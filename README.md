## 📁 Project Structure



There are certain defects for now. 
I added 15 secs timer if amazon asks you to solve puzzle or different verification, you can use your mouse to do so.
Amazon sometimes shows a different UI homepage. So added a refresh function after first time page loads for every Suite start so that a regular UI HOME is displayed.
